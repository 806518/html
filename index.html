        <h1><strong>The Importance of Technology</strong></h1><br>
        <br>
        <h3>In the present day and age, the whole world is using electronic devices in everyday life.<br>
         They've been used for a long time now and as time goes they become more advanced and more prevalent.<br>
         At this point if technology was removed from society I believe we'd be severely crippled and we'd have a tough time getting back on our feet. That's how reliant we've become,<br>
         Even going so far as to make voice command devices that respond to question and do things for you, and little robots that roam your house and clean the floors.<br>
         <br>
           <h3> We all own thse magic tablets called cellphones. We use them to converse with distant friends and family <br>
            and we use them to play videogames and to check the weather forecast or to plan events. Such a nifty device is in our pocket, always there to tend to all our little needs.</h3>

         <h3>Of course we all know what social media is. We all use it, or <em>have</em> used it at the very least. it's a good way to connect with family and friends, as well as people you've never met.<br>
          You can share fun memories on these platform and talk to people over long distances. As you know these platforms are a double edged sword;arguments start due to differing opinions, people make fun of those who are different than them, etc. For reasons like these, anonymy and other failsafes exist but they don't always work. It's important that you secure your own safety.

 <h3>We've arrived at an age where we can wear mini smartphones on our wrists, easily accesible and impossible to lose track of. It's capable of calling, keeping track of your steps each day, playing time killing videogames and a lot more. it's all done on this little bracelet.</h3><br>
